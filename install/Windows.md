## 1. Introduction

Unfortunately, Windows is not the optimal system to set up HOOMD-blue molecular dynamics package as it isn't supported out of the box. **However** it is still possible to use Windows machines to run HOOMD-blue simulations. To set up a Windows system to install and run the HOOMD-blue simulation package, one needs to have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) set up. Please refer to [this](./WSL.md) guide to set up WSL on your Windows Machine.
