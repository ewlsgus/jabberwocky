    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a starting place for running HOOMD-blue molecular dynamics simulations. It is recommended that you read the official HOOMD-blue tutorial (<https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0.1/tutorial/01-Introducing-Molecular-Dynamics/01-Molecular-Dynamics-Simulations.html>) that contains some basic information that can help you to understand the basic set-up of the simulation scripts before going through this notebook. This document will hopefully help you to remember and get more familiar with the HOOMD-blue classes/functions and Python syntax to use them."
